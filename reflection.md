- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
This hierarchy is very convinent for an big object with some subset inside. So when we are programming the subclasses, we should always check what's happened in the "father class". Therefore, we will know what we can simple override and what we should add to the class.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I learnt the usage of "getOrDefault(Object key, V defaultValue)" method -- Returns the value to which the specified key is mapped, or defaultValue if this map contains no mapping for the key -- in the hashtable class. Before knowing this method, the "isAvailable()" method in Library class stocked me for a long time.
